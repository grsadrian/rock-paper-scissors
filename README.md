# Rock, paper, scissors 🪨📜✂️

## About 📝
- This is the first JavaScript project in [The Odin Project Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).
### How does it work ? 🧐
- It simulates a 5-round game of rock, paper, scissors. The computer randomly chooses one of the 3 options, while you choose from an input one of the options.
- After the choices are made, comparisons will be made between the chosen options and the winner of the round will be determined based on the original game rules. The winner will be displayed on the console, and the players' scores will increase based on the winner.
- After the end of the 5 rounds, the total score of the computer and the human will be displayed on the console.
### How to play ? 🎮
- When you enter the page, click on the yellow button "Play Game". A game of 5 rounds will start, click on the desired option (rock, paper or scissors). Below will be displayed your choice, the choice of computer and the result. A table below will display the players' score. At the end of 5 rounds the game ends, and you can start it again by clicking the "Play game" button.
